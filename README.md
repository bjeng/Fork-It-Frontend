# Fork It
Fork It is a mobile app idea to help users decide what to do when they hangout with their friends. The app originally began as a simple decision-maker which broke a complicated decision down into its simpler parts. For example, while somebody may not know what they want to eat, they may know for certain that they're looking for something inexpensive. A typical user experience asks 3-5 simple question and intelligently narrows the user's final decision to three choices. Each of the options has details on the restaurant as well the option to map, Uber, or Lyft to the destination immediately. Future features of the project will include discovery tools for nightlife, arts/culture, and live events.

# User Login/Registration
Users are able to easily register via facebook or email. Their data is stored as future plans exist to retain user preferences, favorite locations/events, as well as friends.

# Playing the Game
The user can choose to view their current events, start an event to invite friends to, or find something to do on their own. Regardless, the core user experience involves a short mini-quiz which includes questions such as price range. If a user truly doesn't care or the timer runs out on them, the choice is made randomly for them.

# Seeing Results
After playing the game through, the user has their decision narrowed down to three choices. They can view details about these choices by clicking on the individual restaurant. They are also able to view their relative location to all of the choices by clicking on Map It. Once again, to encourage greater spontaneity, the user can click Take a Gamble to have the app choose randomly for them. Upon making a decision, the user is able to call the restaurant directly, view reviews on Yelp, make a reservation on Open Table, or direct themselves via Maps, Uber, or Lyft by clicking on Fork It.

# Playing with Friends
Another problem that Fork It addresses is the difficulty in making plans with friends. In multiplayer mode, users can create events and edit its details with each of the drop-down sections. They can then add friends to the event. Once the event is created, invitees are invited to play the mini-quiz. The app will then intelligently help the group come to a decision!
